Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer #1: Paper is well written with only a few suggested grammatical
changes :
1. p7 missing eq link
    Fixed

2. p7 reword the text "estimated exactly", it is either estimated or exact, not
  both
    Fixed

3. p11 in III.B I suggest reviewing the sentence that starts with " The L and R
  moments ..." the ending especially doesn't read well "to simplify moments".
    I clarified the sentence.

4. p12 change "of the T" to "of T"
    Fixed

5. p12 I suggest replacing the word "negativities" by "negative values" appears
  at least 5 times in article, this is a wrong use of the noun negativity
    Fixed

6. p17 word missing, "residual source AT each iteration m"
    Fixed

7. p18 what type of equilibrium, I am assuming thermal equilibrium?
    Fixed

As for the content, I do have a few general comments for the authors to
consider
- p17 The authors discuss the benefits of exponentially converging MC compared
  to standard MC.  I was interested in finding a bit more, but reference 10 is
not available outside of A&M.  From my understanding, it can be demonstrated
mathematically that the convergence rate will be exponential if we assume that
there is no correlation between batches.  This assumption might be valid for
the simple problems analyzed but does it hold on realistic problems where the
transport operation as a near unity spectral radius?


- p17 The discussion on mesh and angular convergence is disjoint since it
  compares to discretization in neutronics problem (angle vs spatial issues),
but then discusses comparisons with standard MC (which doesn't have any
discretization).  This paragraph should be revised to clearly state the need
for discretization in the HOLO method, but that no such discretization is
needed in the MC problem.  The article makes it seem that the HOLO method will
reproduce exactly MC results, but should instead clearly state that it
represents at high fidelity approximation of the standard MC solution due to
the discretization introduced.
- p18 The authors mention a continuous weight loss weighing scheme.  How is
  this handled at a material crossing.  Is the distance traveled resampled? or
is sampling done on the basis of mean free paths thus continuing seamlessly
across an interface?
- p19 The authors introduce a completely arbitrary cutoff of 10-4 where they
  choose not to simulate anymore particles.  Should this cutoff be problem
dependent? and couldn't this lead to biases depending on the location of these
regions with respect to the source?
- The 1-D results are good, but the real key is on how the method will perform
  on realistic problems with real physics (beyond one group).  The authors do
discuss this as potential future work, but if such results do exist now it
would certainly strengthen the paper.  Many methods look great in 1D, 1 group.


Reviewer #2: This work presents a novel "high order, low order" acceleration
method for accurately and efficiently solving thermal radiative transfer
problems. The method is well-described and put into appropriate context with
the literature. The method has several hurdles to overcome before it would see
widespread deployment, but this paper establishes that the method can be
advantageously deployed in a limited setting.

 Here are some suggestions for improvement before final publication:

p.3 absorption-reemission (extra space); "optically thick" needs no hyphen

Changed.

p.6 "similar statistical efficiency by choosing the old intensity as the
initial guess"…Actually, the authors of [8] went to some length to choose
their "I^+" in a way that eliminated volumetric sources after first
considering the old intensity as the initial guess (see their Eq. (39)).

I briefly described this difference in the article.  Although, for a linear
spatial shape of the intensity, it is not possible to eliminate the interior source without
assuming a flat solution.

p.7 Unresolved Eq. number

Updated.

p.8 Some in-line references (as were done in the introduction) would help in
the middle paragraph.

I added some references and cleaned up the content a little.
I clarified that the projection of the exact solution is to the characteristic
problem where there is a LDFE spatial representation of sources.

p. 10 "which we denote consistency" —> "which we denote as consistency"

changed

p. 12 It would be nice to see some discussion or analysis regarding whether
the coupled system retains the equilibrium diffusion limit. We know that it
will not exhibit maximum principle violations since it is time-implicit (this
should be clearly stated; reference Larsen, Kumar, and Morel, JCP vol. 238,
2013). The time-implicit behavior should also lend itself to preserving the
equilibrium diffusion limit (see Densmore & Larsen, JCP vol. 199, 2004). The
particulars of the LDFE spatial discretization is the larger concern when
coupled with a MC HO method, but there is evidence to suggest it will be OK in
the literature.

I added a line and reference about the equilibrium diffusion limit and maximum
principle violations to the beginning paragraph on page 8.  I also discussed
why we expect the diffusion limit to hold in a new paragraph on Pg 12 with
references.

p. 16/17 Any mention of difficulties encountered and overcome with negative
particle weights would be helpful to the field.

We have not noticed any particular numerical difficulties as of yet with negative particles.  I added more detail of the
sampling process (in particular determining the negative and positive weights
of particles) to the end of the third paragraph in section IV. 

p. 21 This is the first location that the location of isotropic scattering (in
the HO or LO) system is explicitly mentioned. It might be worth introducing
that earlier. Also, the logical next question in future work will be whether
you can include anisotropic and/or multifrequency (Compton) scattering in this
approach — this question does not appear to be answered, even speculatively.

p. 22 You may want to call out in the text that the FOMs are two orders of
magnitude higher!

p. 23 "simulation is ran" —> "simulation is run"
also "wave front" should be one word, "wavefront"
again, explicitly mention the orders of magnitude reduction in variance shown
in Table III

Changed to "The simulation end time is 5 sh."
Changed wave front to wavefront throughout.

p.24, In comparing the cost of the effective scattering, are any scattering
acceleration schemes (random walk, DDMC) used in the IMC? This should be
stated explicitly. DDMC papers can indicate the expected time reduction for
comparable problems, but you may have enough margin to overcome this by
addressing it with a statement instead of implementing the comparison.



p. 28 In future work it would be nice to see comparisons to problems with
analytic (or, at least, highly converged) solutions to compare the *overall*
accuracy to existing methods. This paper makes clear that the errors being
analyzed are always statistical, but it does not analyze or quantify the
magnitude of the discretization errors. I believe the assertion that they are
acceptable in comparison to the statistical errors in IMC, but future work
should better quantify this. (I consider this a "proof-of-principle" paper —
it remains to be seen if this entire scheme works in multi-frequency and
multi-D).
